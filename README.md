## Overview

### Links

- Live Site URL: [GitHub Page](https://pizpit.github.io/qr-code-component/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I mainly learned how to fully deploy and host a website on GitHub Pages. Most of the HTML and CSS was review but I learned more about markdown while making this README.

### Useful resources

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - This website taught me how to publish my repo as a live website.
